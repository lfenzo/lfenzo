## About Me

Computer Science BSc. (graduated from the [Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos](https://www.ufscar.br/) in 2022) and Data Scientist at [BigData](https://www.linkedin.com/company/big-data-brasil-/), currently working on forecast pipelines and data analysis.

Although most of my effort is centered around the Machine Learning area, I also enjoy studying and working on topics such as IoT, Process Automatization, 3D Printing and contributing to open source projects.

*I like to design and automate things.*
